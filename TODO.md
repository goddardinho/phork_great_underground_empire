# Gameplay Duplication Framework - Todo List

1. Core Data Structures
   - Define Python classes for Room, Object, Player, Action, etc., based on the structures in defs.mud and rooms.mud.
2. Parser
   - Implement a command parser to interpret player input, inspired by parser.mud.
3. Game Loop
   - Create a main loop in main.py to handle input, update game state, and display output.
4. Room and Object Initialization
   - Load room and object definitions from source files or Python equivalents.
5. Action Dispatch
   - Map player commands to actions using a dispatcher, as seen in disp1.mud.
